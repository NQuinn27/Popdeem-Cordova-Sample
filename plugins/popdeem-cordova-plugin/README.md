# Popdeem Cordova Plugin
The Popdeem Cordova plugin allows you to use the Popdeem native iOS and Android SDKs inside your Cordova cross-platform application. Currently iOS and Android are supported

# Usage
## Add the plugin to your project
`cordova plugin add popdeem-cordova-plugin`

## Build the projects
`cordova build ios`
`cordova build android`

This will result in the PopdeemSDK pod being pulled into your iOS project, and the PopdeemSDK maven library being pulled into your Android project.

## Configuration
### iOS
See [Popdeem iOS Docs](http://iosdocs.popdeem.com) and complete the **info.plist additions** and **initialize SDK** steps. To do this you will need to locate the necessary files (`AppDelegate.m` & `projectname-info.plist`) in the iOS project generated by Cordova. This is the minimum needed to get up and running. If you use native push notifications, the _Broadcast Features_ steps can also be completed.

### Android

## Social Login
To launch the social login popover from javascript, use the following:
`popdeem.enableSocialLogin(3, function() {}, function() {});`
The first parameter is the _numberOfPrompts_ argument. The popover is dismissible by the user - this argument denotes the maximum number of times a user can see this popover.

## Popdeem Home
To show the Popdeem Home flow from javascript, use the following:
`popdeem.pushPopdeemHome(function() {}, function() {});`. Popdeem Home encapsulates all of Popdeemâ€™s functionality.
